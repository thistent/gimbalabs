## About Gimbalabs

Gimbalabs creates scaffolding for a robust and resilient global network of leaders, devOps pioneers, builders, and educators because we know that in the hands of many, Cardano will help to solve real problems.

To be robust and reslient, a network requires infrastructure and people who know how to use it. We are building Dandelion so that anyone can deploy critical infrastructure for interacting with the Cardano protocol. We are building Project-Based Learning courses so that people get first-hand experience using technical tools and sharing decision-making power.

We believe that people learn best by doing things. If you've been looking for an entry point into how you can participate in Cardano, we think you might find it here. If you want to learn more about the people behind Gimbalabs, check out the videos page or join one of weekly community meetings. If you want to start learning, [take a look at our Plutus PBL Course](https://plutuspbl.io/).

### What we're building

Our founding team met by engaging deeply in [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/). We recognized that by sharing ideas and seeking connections between projects, we could start a process that led to more people solving more problems and building more solutions on Cardano. You can still [read our original proposal here](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Starter-Kits-+-APIs/322195-48088).

Here are some things we are working on right now:

#### Dandelion

Dandelion is both a set of services and a containerized framework for deploying those services. We are currently teaching operators how to run Kubernetes to deploy a Dandelion node, and we are building ways for those nodes to communicate seamlessly to provide distributed access to Cardano. [Learn more](https://www.gimbalabs.com/dandelion).

#### Project-Based Learning

We are piloting a "Plutus Project-Based Learning" (PPBL) team that gives developers a chance to gain hands on experience with Plutus by working on real projects. One outcome of PPBL is that we are creating documentation and task suggestions for additional developers to learn Plutus by using it. Another is that we will apply what we are learning about Project-Based Learning to other tools, like Atala Prism and Dandelion.

#### Playground

At weekly Playground meetings, community members can share ideas. Join us every Tuesday at 5pm UTC - all details are on the Gimbalabs Discord server and on our community calendar.

#### Projects

There are several projects that we are eager to release in the next few months. Take a look around this site to learn more about what we are building. As each project is released, we will share it here.

## Principles

-   Learn by Doing
    
    When we have experiences, our learning is real.
    
-   Collaborate
    
    New technology always creates new ways for people to collaborate, and blockchain is no different.
    
-   Stay Flexible
    
    We don't know exactly where this new technology will take us, so we create space for incomplete ideas and we embrace uncertainty.
