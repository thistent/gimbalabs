# Scopes of Authority, Correctness Guarantees, and the Liberty of Contributors

## Motivation

- "Software Unscripted" podcast by Richard Feldman
  - Feldman is a wellknown Elm developer who is currently creating a new language called Roc
- There are different ways that language designers can interact with the community that develops around the language
- The strategy you choose to interact with community members can have a major effect on the way your project develops over time
- The same principles can apply to any type of project that builds a community around it
- Beneficial restrictions on the design of systems could also be applied to community interactions

## Questions to Think About

- How could we scale collaboration?
- What are our goals in collaborating?
- How can people's work fit together?
- How can we maximize experiments while minimizing duplicated work?
